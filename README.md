# A bit about me
Hello there! I'm Ema, a high schooler from Croatia who is in love with astrophysics, physics and programming. I do research, go to math and astronomy competitions, and have even competed in IOAA. I'm also super into reading and art :)

# Skills
For all my research, I work in Python in which I have advanced usage, especially for data analysis. I also have some experience with HTML/CSS. 

# My work & competitions
My main work is **research**, and I have done several thus far and have a lot more planned for the future:

- _Analysis of exoplanetary systems_ - creating extrasolar systems, categorizing exoplanets and trying to find patterns in the planetary world outside of our solar system
- _Neural networks: recognizing galaxy mergers_ - CNN designed to recognize if an image is a galaxy merger or not based on simualted data, a Hello Universe project from MAST https://archive.stsci.edu/hello-universe
- _Analysis of the Blazhko Effect for Field RR Lyrae Stars using LINEAR and ZTF Light Curves_ - a collaborative project with dr. Ivezić, trying to find new Blazhko stars in the field with 2 independent surveys 10 years appart (future published paper, still in progress!)
- I competed in the NASA Space Apps Challenge in 2023 - where our team CHeDDaR won first prize in Croatia!
