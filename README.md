# A bit about me
Hello there! I'm Ema, a high-schooler from Croatia who is in love with astrophysics, physics and programming. I do research, go to math and astronomy competitions. I'm also super into reading and art :)

# Skills
For all my research, I work in Python in which I have advanced usage, especially for data analysis. I also have some experience with HTML/CSS. 

# My work & competitions
My main work is **research**, and I have done several projects thus far and have a lot more planned for the future:

- _Search for the Blazhko Effect in Field RR Lyrae Stars Using LINEAR and ZTF Light Curves_ - a collaborative project with dr. Ivezić, trying to find new Blazhko stars in the field with 2 independent surveys 10 years appart. With the project finished successfully, our research has been published May 15th in the **Astronomical Journal**! We found 228 new Blazhko field stars! (2024-2025) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05434)
- _Neural networks: recognizing galaxy mergers_ - CNN designed to recognize if an image is a galaxy merger or not based on simualted data, a Hello Universe project from MAST https://archive.stsci.edu/hello-universe (2023)
- _Analysis of exoplanetary systems_ - creating extrasolar systems, categorizing exoplanets and trying to find patterns in the planetary world outside of our solar system (2022)

In addition to research, I also competed in the following:
- [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023](https://github.com/emadonev/hackathon2023) - our team CHeDDaR won first prize in Croatia!
- [Breakthrough Junior Challenge 2022](https://breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org/winners/2022) - top 5 finalist!
- [IOAA 2024](https://ioaa2024.on.br/index.html) 150. place
- Croatian National competition in astronomy - twice champion, 3 times second place
